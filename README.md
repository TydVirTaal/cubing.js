`cubing.js` is a collection of JavaScript libraries, still under development.

## Twizzle

<a href="https://alpha.twizzle.net/"><img src="./src/sites/alpha.twizzle.net/twizzle-social-media-image.png" width="256">

Twizzle</a> is the spiritual successor to [alg.cubing.net](https://alg.cubing.net/), based on `cubing.js`. It is currently being developed at [src/sites/alpha.twizzle.net](./src/sites/alpha.twizzle.net/).

See the [Twizzle Diaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_kqXn0Mq-o&list=PLFh3NgpDbzN4VkcfjEZSQ_TYQv_OEjbjF) video series for more information on Twizzle's vision and use cases.

## Getting started

If you aren't sure where to get started, you should start with `cdn.cubing.net`, which lets you implement cubing.js in a website. 

If you're already comfortable with writing web apps using `npm`, see the "`Using with Node.js`" section below.

The following code is a good way to get started with `cdn.cubing.net`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.cubing.net/js/cubing/twisty" type="module"></script>
<twisty-player alg="R U R' U R U2' R'"></twisty-player>
```

You can find more documentation at [js.cubing.net/cubing/](https://js.cubing.net/cubing).  
The source for the documentation site is currently inside the [docs](./docs/) folder of this repository.

## Using with Node.js  

If you would like to use cubing.js as a library in your Node projects, make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) installed (installing `node` will install `npm` as well). Once you have installed those, you can run:

```shell
npm install cubing
```

The following modules are a good starting point: 
```shell
import { Alg } from "cubing/alg";
import { TwistyPlayer } from "cubing/twisty"; 
```


## Contributing

## Developing `cubing.js`

If you would like to contribute to the development of `cubing.js`, please refer to our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

To work on the `cubing.js` source code, you'll need to install [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) (installing `node` will install `npm` as well). Once you have installed those, you can run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js && cd cubing.js
make dev
```

This should install a few dependencies and start the server, after which you can open <http://localhost:3333/>. Some tips:

The core library code for `cubing.js` is in [`src/cubing`](./src/cubing/). To test changes, use:

```shell
make test
```

- See [`src/README.md`](./src/README.md) for the source code structure.
  - The core library code for `cubing.js` is in [`src/cubing`](./src/cubing/).
  - The code for Twizzle and dev experiments is in [`src/sites`](./src/sites/).
